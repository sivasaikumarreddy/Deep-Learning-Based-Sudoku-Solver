# Deep-Learning-Based-Sudoku-Solver

The project objective is to train a deep learning model that can solve a Sudoku puzzle from an image. The Project has been divided into two tasks.

## Task - 1:
To train a model to read the Sudoku puzzle to know which digits there are and where are their placed withing the Sudoku grid.

## Task - 2:
To train a model to actually solve the Sudoku , that is to complete the empty cells in the grid with the correct digits.


## Files :

    - `Task - 1.ipynb`  : The Notebook file related to the Task -1 of the project mentioned above.
    - `cnn_fully_trained.pth` : The saved pytorch model that is trained on the images to identify the digits.

- Task - 2
    - `Data Preparation for Task - 2.ipynb` : The Intermediate file to make the given images ready for the next part of the project.
    - `TASK - 2 ( Training).ipynb` : Notebook File to train deep learning networks on the sudoku grids predicted from the task-1 trained models.
